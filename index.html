<p>My hobby is making some awesome crafts in my free time. Crafting is a lot of fun and helps me be super creative and not loose the creative and goofy side of me. It helps me get all my frustration and stress out. It also helps me deal with boredom. I'm 11 years old and I study in class 7th. I know very well that its equaly as important to perform some arts and crafts than study and get good grades. This hobby takes some practice to that hang of but once you do get the hang of it its a lot of fun and you enjoy it, I got it naturally. Crafting keeps one happy and busy. Its a good soarce of enjoyment, creativity and inspiration. It makes us focused and concetrated on what we are doing, it also makes us perfectionists because when you're crafting if something is off point even by a milimeter it messes up the whole thing. I think its a great habit to adapt to because sometimes in life everything needs to be on point and perfect.</p>
